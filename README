There isn't really a README for nekobee yet.

You've got as far as extracting the tarball or cloning the git repo.  This is good.
As of 0.1.8, nekobee uses waf instead of autotools.  Don't worry, you don't need to install anything else.

Configure:
$ ./waf configure
Build:
$ ./waf
Install (do this as root, or use sudo):
# ./waf install

You didn't really need me to tell you that, did you?

The default install directory is /usr/local/lib/dssi/ which can be changed by passing --prefix to ./waf configure

Launch the plugin with your favourite DSSI host.  Something like "jack-dssi-host nekobee.so" will do it.

Nekobee supports continuous controllers since 0.1.5 - these are listed below.

// nekobee defines

Tuning:		0x4b	//
Waveform:	0x46	// select waveform
Cutoff:		0x4A	// VCF Cutoff
Resonance:	0x47	// VCF Resonance
Env modulation:	0x01	// cheat and use modwheel
Decay:		0x48	// Decay time (well release really)
Accent Level:	0x4	// 
Volume:		0x07	// standard main volume

The decay knob works backwards.  This will be fixed, but will break old values for the knob.
