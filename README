There isn't really a README for nekobee yet.

You've got as far as extracting the tarball.  This is good.
Say "./configure" - this bit isn't set up right because I'm crap at autotools.
The autoconf scripts might fail to notice if you don't have liblo, dssi or some development libraries.
Once configure has done its thing, use make and make install - the default place to put it is /usr/local/lib/dssi/nekobee
If you get compilation errors, you're probably missing a library.  Please report it to gordon@gjcp.net

Launch the plugin with your favourite DSSI host.  Something like "jack-dssi-host nekobee.so" will do it.

Nekobee supports continuous controllers since 0.1.5 - these are listed below.

// nekobee defines

Tuning:		0x4b	//
Waveform:	0x46	// select waveform
Cutoff:		0x4A	// VCF Cutoff
Resonance:	0x47	// VCF Resonance
Env modulation:	0x01	// cheat and use modwheel
Decay:		0x48	// Decay time (well release really)
Accent Level:	0x4	// 
Volume:		0x07	// standard main volume

The decay knob works backwards.  This will be fixed, but will break old values ofor the knob.
